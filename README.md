# Supplementary Material

This repository contains supplementary material for paper titled *'A collection of Constraint Programming models for the three-dimensional stable matching problem with cyclic preferences'* to accommodate blind-review process for the CP 2021. 

The files included are:

## SupplementaryMaterial.pdf
A. An example for the three-dimensional stable matching problem with cyclic preferences. 
B. Pointer to the dataset files.
C. Additional plots to support the reasoning of search strategy selection for each model in the experiments section of the original paper.
D. A comparison of the models with their selected search strategies in terms of the number of failures during the search. 

## Dataset.tar.xz
This folder contains all the 3DSM-cyc instances that were used during experiments. The instances contain N agents from each set, where N = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130}.
